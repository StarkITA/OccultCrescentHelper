## Plans
-   Auto find active carrot
-   Instance hopper 
    -   `/och instance 54` (Or something like this), Then it keeps leaving and joining until you get into that instance
    -   Only if I find a more reliable Instance ID

## Known issues

-   Treasure hunter gets stuck on the last chest
-   Treasure hunter doesn't communicate to an average player what chest # it is on, and how many spots it is checking
-   Instance ID, lmao
-   Users who can't read
